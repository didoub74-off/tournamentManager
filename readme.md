# Tournament Generator

This is a simple tournament generator for my badminton club. It is a simple application that allows you to create a tournament with a list of players and generate a random or a seeded round for the tournament.

## Language 

I know the program is in French and thers's no plan to translate it in English. But if you want to do it, you can fork the project and do it ;)

## Why did I create this?

I created this application because we needed a way to generate a tournament for our badminton club. We have a list of players and we wanted to generate a tournament with a random or seeded round.

## How does it work?

The application is very simple. You can create a tournament by providing a list of players. You can then generate one or more rounds for the tournament. You can choose to generate a random round or a seeded round.

## How to use it?

It's very easy, I am sure you can figure it out. Just follow the instructions on the screen.

## What's next?

Probably nothing. I created this application for my badminton club and I don't plan to add any new features. But if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

## License

Do whatever you want with this code. It's free and open source. No restrictions. Just have fun and maybe credit me if you use it (that's not even required but still appreciated).
